Meeting on a popular dating app (no, not that one) in 2017, when Simon left the UK to 'find himself' in the most eye wateringly expensive way possible (a master's degree) and Devon had recently moved back to Boston from NYC and London, we had our first date at a hip-hop playing wine bar after extensive online stalking of each other to make sure we weren't being catfished.

On the first date, we clicked instantly, chatting about our families, photography, Americanism vs Britcisms and Liverpool Football Club.  Simon immediately thought Devon was beautiful and fun and Devon thought Simon was handsome and sweet. Only two hurdles stood in the way of a life-long love affair: Simon's British tipping (note to Brits: "only" 10% is offensive to waiting staff in the US, apparently!) and the pain of Devon's high heels leading to her less than emphatic response to the question: "would you like to go out again?" at the end of the night when Simon walked her back. 

But we luckily found ourselves on several next dates, bravely soldiering on through the early transatlantic etiquette challenges thrown at us. We had an absolute blast together during that blustery Boston winter. We  skated on Frog Pond (where Simon, having never skated before, may have clung to the rink walls a little too hard and has only just regained full use of his leg muscles), we had an epic snowball fight after a big storm, where Simon made up for his lack of skating prowess with killer aim and an unnerving willingness to snow-waterboard Devon (see photo of Devon’s eyeglasses caked with snow as evidence!) and we indulged in our shared chocoholism and food fondness by drinking loads of hot chocolate from Burdick’s and eating our way around every cozy restaurant in town.  

One night before we left to celebrate the holidays with our families, we took a snowy walk and played ping pong outside on the Harvard campus. Freezing, we went into the nearby Science Center and huddled on a wooden bench to warm each other up. That moment is when Simon knew he loved Devon and wanted to marry her. Three vacations, two (babysat) cats and one lease later, Simon brought Devon back to that very bench and gave her a handmade book with photos from all of their adventures together. When she flipped to the last page, it said “Marry Me?” (check out the photo above!) 

We are so excited to celebrate our wedding with all of our friends and family – we cannot wait to see you!

Love,

Devon and Simon
