Duxbury is a historic New England town on the stretch of coast between Boston and Cape Cod. It is peak summer weather at the end of August with loads of fun activities. Here are a few of our favorite suggestions:  

<h2>Activities in Duxbury:</h2> 

<b>Duxbury Beach</b> – get some beach days in while you’re here! Duxbury Beach is a barrier beach that separates Duxbury Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. For those visiting from out of town, you can park on the mainland and walk across the bridge to access the beach.

<b>Powder Point Bridge</b> – take a scenic 10-minute walk across this wooden bridge connecting the mainland to Duxbury Beach. At low tide, you’ll find people digging for clams and at high tide you’ll get to see fisherman looking for bluefish and snappers. Keep an eye out for Clark's Island in Duxbury Bay visited by famous writers Truman Capote, Henry David Thoreau and Louisa May Alcott.
